Update:
I was able to solve day 7, part 2, using the 3rd.py script.


Update:
I was able to solve day 7, part 1, with some of the ugliest code I've ever written.
Essentially day7.py prints out a bunch of size info which I wrote to `secondary_input.txt`.
Then, 2nd.py reads _that_ file and sums the entries where the number is < 100k.


Problem:

I can't currently handle more than one `cd ..` in a row because I am using two args to do it:
- direc: the current directory object
- prev_direc: the previous directory object

Currently, when I call `cd ..`, it says, "OK, let's make the directory we're in now the prev_direc, and we'll make the previous directory equal to the current directory". This works, but only for a single upward traversal.

The sample input calls two `cd ..` commands in a row, so my code breaks.

In order to fix this, I need to use the absolute pathnames stored in the root_dir object's `path` attribute.

For example:
1. Pass in the root_dir object on every call to the function `process_commands()`
2.
