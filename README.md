# Advent of Code 2022

I'm trying to do as much of the Advent of Code 2022 in Rust as I can.
Rust is a language I've only toyed with in the past and haven't really used for work.
Since the Advent is already hard and defeats me after 6-10 days, this year will be even harder.

## Notes
Each crab 🦀 and snake 🐍 emoji represents a correct answer for one of the two puzzles from each day.
The crab means I solved it in Rust, and a snake means I gave up on Rust and solved it in Python.

# Progress
